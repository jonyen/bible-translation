Bible Translation App
=====================
This is a web app that fetches Bible passages & verses from different translations, then allows the user to easily copy and paste the text into a document. I created this for the Elderly Care Ministry at Gracepoint Berkeley, so that people who are printing out the bulletins don't need to go through the hassle of looking up the verse, changing the translation, and then looking it up again in another translation.
